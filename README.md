# avro_project_skeleton
It is generally a good practice to store Avro schemas in a single location to avoid project inter-dependencies. The goal of this project is to provide a skeleton so that the Avro schemas you create could be used easily to generate various corresponding classes in different languages.

File src/main/avro/example.avsc is there only for documentation purpose and can be safely removed. However it is located where your Avro schema files should be stored.
